# CS50W Project 2: Commerce

This is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that I designed which allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”

# Specification

Create Listing: Users can visit a page to create a new listing. They can specify a title for the listing, write a text-based description, determine the starting bid, provide a URL for an image for the listing, and choose a category (e.g. Fashion, Toys, Electronics, etc.).

Active Listings: In their home page, users can view all of the currently active listings.

Listing Page: By clicking on a listing, users will be taken to a page that allows them to view all the details about the listing, such as the price. If the user is sign, the user can add that listing to their watchlist, (or remove that listing if the listing is already on their watchlist). Additionally, users can comment and bid on listings. The owner can decide when to close the bid. 

Dashboard: On their dashboard, users can see their account info, including their watchlist and the listings that they had won.

Categories: Users can visit a page that displays a list of all of the listing categories. Clicking on a category will take users to a page displaying all of the active listings that belong to that category.

Django Admin Interface: Via the Django admin interface, a site administrator can view, add, edit, and delete any listings, comments, and bids made on the site.

I created this website using Django. Hope you enjoy!
